                    <h2>LAl Mahal</h2>
                    <p>The original Lal Mahal was built with the idea of rejuvenating the recently razed
                        city of Pune when Shahaji Raje entered the city along with Shivaji and his mother, Maasaheb Jijabai. 
                        Young Shivaji grew up here, and stayed in the Lal Mahal till he captured the Torna fort in 1645.
                        Shivaji's marriage with his first wife, Saibai took place in Lal Mahal on 16 May 1640.
                       The Lal Mahal is also famous for an encounter between Shivaji and Shaista Khan
                       where Shivaji cut off four fingers of the latter's when he was trying to escape from the first-floor
                        window of the Lal Mahal.

                    <h2>shaniwarwada</h2>
                    <p>The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire.
                        It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story, 
                        the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument 
                        can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the 
                       Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone.  </div>
